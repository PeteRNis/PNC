i followed along with the steps here

and i removed check and replaced it with validate

Project organization:

We will have three main components of the project:
(Project views) [models]
  1. Core (Index, Info)
  2. Users (Register, Login, Logout, Account, User Posts) [id, Profile Image, Email, Username, Password, Posts]
  3. Blog Posts (Create, Update, Delete, Blog Post) [id, User_id, Date, Title, Text]

We need two models, one that is represented in users and one for blog posts.

The models are going to be connected, because the Id is present in both. In that way,
we can click on a user and see all the block posts they have created.

We will use a blueprint structure, to avoid everything going into the app.py file.





{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block content %}

{% endblock %}
